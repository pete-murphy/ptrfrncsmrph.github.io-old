## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we're going to build a game of tic-tac-toe.
It will be identical in functionality to the end result of the [official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), but we'll be using PureScript (specifically the `purescript-react-basic-hooks` library) and leveraging a functional programming approach.
We'll also be building a parallel implementation using TypeScript and `fp-ts`, for sake of comparison.
The final result in PureScript can be found here, and the final TypeScript version here.
The hope is that the three versions (the original JavaScript, the functional-style TypeScript, and the idiomatic PureScript) might serve as a Rosetta Stone-style reference for newcomers to PureScript who are already familiar with one of the other two.

## Prerequisites

We'll assume some familiarity with the original tutorial, so the reader is encouraged to work through that if you haven't already.
Though we won't necessarily assume familiarity with PureScript, we also won't be going too far in depth in our coverage of the basics of the language.
For a more in-depth guide to PureScript from first principles, I would recommend [_PureScript by Example_](https://book.purescript.org/).
This guide is instead intended as an in-road to PureScript for those already familiar with React, and who might benefit from seeing how React's concepts are expressed in this language.

### The Type of a React Component

Following the original, we are going to split our tic-tac-toe app into three React components: `game`, `board` and `square` (names of values start with lowercase in PureScript, so we're not following the React convention of "user-defined components must be capitalized").
We tend to think of components in React, especially those that have no internal state or use any hooks, as literal functions that take some `props` type as input and return some `JSX`.
In PureScript we could then represent the type of a `Component` as just that.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```purescript
type Component props = props -> JSX
```

```typescript
type Component<Props> = (props: Props) => JSX;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

This definition, while correct in a naive sense, is not the whole of the picture in the React execution context(?).
React advises defining components at the module-level, instead of inside the function body of other components, for example.
This is because React relies on referential equality between component instances in its reconciliation.
This reliance on referential equality violates the sensibilities of a language such as PureScript hwere one expects to be able to reason equationally.
I.e., the meaning and behavior of some value `foo` shouldn't depend in what context `foo` is defined.
In [this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/re-rendering-lists-9iweo?file=/src/App.js:652-661), `List` and `ListAlias` would be equivalent under equational reasoning, but it is plain to see they are not.
To reflect this, in PureScript this is encoded as "effectful" to encourage components to be instantiated in a "bootstrapping" phase, instead of inside of a render cycle.
